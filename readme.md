# Discord Bot Session Bot Examples

This repository contains the examples I am going to showcase at our first 
show and tell for Tesseract Coding. 

This session is supposed to be on the topic of Creating Discord Bots. 

I have two sample discord bots created in the folders `./hello_bot` and 
`./commands_bot` folders respectively. 

Theres also a secrets.json.bak file which is to be converted to `secrets.json` 
and in it has to be the discord bot token that you will get from the discord
developers bot creation page.

Both Bots are samples and follow different building architectures. 

`Hello_bot` uses standard oop architecture and does the job while 
`commands_bot` has a more declarative way of doing things. 

They do fairly simple things and it can be easily understood what they are 
trying to do by just looking at the code itself. 

For more information you can look at the session here at [link](#)
